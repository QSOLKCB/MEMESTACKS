# 🧠 QSOL Philosophy  
*“Small is beautiful. Fast is holy.”*

## 🧩 Core Principles
**MEMESTACKS** isn’t a framework — it’s a *discipline.*  
Every line of code should justify its watt.  
Every package should earn its place.  
The system should exist to serve the human, not the other way around.

We build like hardware engineers:  
tight tolerances, minimal drift, and visible circuits.  
Simplicity isn’t a style — it’s a performance multiplier.

## ⚙️ Design Ethos
- **Clarity over cleverness.**  
  Readable beats “smart.” Anyone should be able to debug this stack half-asleep.  

- **No silent abstraction.**  
  If something happens, it should happen *where you can see it.*  

- **Zero bloat tolerance.**  
  If a command can be replaced by `awk`, `sed`, or `grep`, it should be.  

- **Human-scale complexity.**  
  Systems should be comprehensible without a whiteboard full of arrows.  

- **Hardware awareness.**  
  Code runs on atoms. Respect the silicon. Optimize like you pay the electric bill.

## 🔭 Why MEMESTACKS Exists
Because modern software forgot how to be small.  
Everything ships with 900MB of “helpful dependencies” and a UI built out of regret.  
**MEMESTACKS** brings the focus back to *bare metal thinking* — simple tools, fast startup, transparent operation.

It’s not anti-framework. It’s anti-laziness.

## 🛠️ Developer Creed
> “Write once, understand forever.”  

If it takes more than one paragraph to explain a script, it’s too clever.  
If it breaks on another machine, it’s too fragile.  
If it can’t be read in a terminal, it doesn’t belong here.

## 🌐 The QSOL Way
QSOL isn’t just software — it’s an attitude.  
A hybrid of hacker pragmatism, scientific rigor, and aesthetic minimalism.  
We build systems that sound good, run fast, and never lie about what they’re doing.

**Efficiency before over-engineering.**  
**Truth before trend.**  
**Beauty through constraint.**
